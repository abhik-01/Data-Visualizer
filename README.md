<h1 align='center'>Data Visualizer</h1>

This is a Data Visualizer to show the market value of every individual player of Fifa 2019.
I've used the Fifa 2019 dataset from kaggle.com for this project.

First, I've cleaned the data
by removing unncessary columns. For this I've used `Pandas`.

Then, with the help of `Seaborn`, I've plotted the data in a graph.

After that, I've used `Bokeh` to visualize every individual data point in the graph. Here the data
points are representing each player of Fifa 2019.

You can hover over a data point to get the details & the market value of a player.
